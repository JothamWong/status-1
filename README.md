# status-1

Understand `git status` by answering some questions about the status of this repository!

## Goal

Perform `git status` and answer the following questions in `answers.txt` (only include the name of the file that you see in `git status`):

1. What file was newly added?
2. What file was edited?

When submitting your file, please only add the `answers.txt` file:

```bash
git add answers.txt
```

## Hints

1. Look for files under the "Untracked files" section
2. Look for files under the "Changes not staged for commit" section
